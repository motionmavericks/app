# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Production Deployment to DigitalOcean
> Created: 2025-09-02

## Overview

Deploy the complete Media Asset Management platform to DigitalOcean App Platform with managed databases, object storage integration, and production-grade security configurations. This deployment will establish a scalable, secure, and monitored production environment capable of handling enterprise creative production workflows.

## User Stories

### DevOps Engineer Deployment Story

As a DevOps engineer, I want to deploy the complete MAM platform to DigitalOcean with a single coordinated process, so that all services are properly configured, secured, and monitored in production.

The deployment workflow involves preparing environment configurations, setting up managed databases (PostgreSQL and Redis), configuring object storage credentials, deploying the four-service architecture through App Platform, validating health endpoints, and establishing monitoring. The process should be repeatable, with rollback capabilities and zero-downtime deployment support for future updates.

### Application Administrator Configuration Story

As an application administrator, I want to configure and verify all production services through a documented process, so that the platform is ready for user onboarding with proper security, performance, and reliability settings.

This includes setting up authentication secrets, configuring rate limiting, establishing backup policies, defining scaling rules, and verifying all integration points between services. The administrator should be able to monitor service health, review logs, and manage environment variables through the DigitalOcean console.

### End User Access Story

As an end user (creative professional), I want to access a fully functional production platform with reliable performance and security, so that I can manage media assets, collaborate on projects, and deliver content efficiently.

Users will access the platform through a custom domain with SSL, experience fast media uploads through presigned URLs, view GPU-processed previews with minimal latency, and collaborate through secure, time-limited sharing links. The platform should handle concurrent users, large file uploads, and streaming playback without degradation.

## Spec Scope

1. **Infrastructure Setup** - Provision DigitalOcean managed databases (PostgreSQL, Redis), configure VPC networking, and establish security groups
2. **Application Deployment** - Deploy all four services (Frontend, Backend API, Worker, Edge) to App Platform with proper resource allocation
3. **Storage Configuration** - Integrate Wasabi S3 buckets with proper IAM credentials and bucket policies for three-tier storage
4. **Security Implementation** - Configure SSL certificates, environment secrets, HMAC signing keys, and authentication tokens
5. **Monitoring & Observability** - Set up health checks, configure alert policies, establish log aggregation, and implement performance monitoring

## Out of Scope

- Migration of existing data from other platforms
- Custom domain email configuration (MX records)
- Third-party integrations beyond core infrastructure
- Disaster recovery site setup (separate region)
- Advanced CDN configuration (CloudFlare/Fastly)
- Kubernetes cluster management (using App Platform instead)
- On-premise backup solutions

## Expected Deliverable

1. Fully deployed Media Asset Management platform accessible via HTTPS with all four services operational, health checks passing, and capable of processing media uploads through the complete pipeline
2. Documented deployment configuration including environment variables, secrets management, service URLs, and administrative access procedures for ongoing maintenance
3. Operational monitoring dashboard with configured alerts for service health, database performance, error rates, and resource utilization thresholds
