- **Monitoring Integration**
  - DigitalOcean native monitoring enabled
  - Custom metrics for media processing
  - Log forwarding to centralized system
  - Alert webhook integration (Slack/Discord)

### Performance Criteria

- **Response Time Targets**
  - API endpoints: < 200ms p95
  - Static assets: < 50ms via CDN
  - Media streaming: < 2s initial buffering
  - Database queries: < 100ms p95

- **Availability Targets**
  - Overall platform: 99.9% uptime
  - API availability: 99.95% uptime
  - Scheduled maintenance window: Sunday 2-4 AM UTC
  - RTO: 1 hour, RPO: 15 minutes

- **Scalability Metrics**
  - Concurrent users: 1000 minimum
  - Upload throughput: 100 MB/s aggregate
  - Processing queue: 50 concurrent jobs
  - Storage capacity: 10TB initial allocation

### Deployment Process

- **Pre-deployment Checklist**
  - Database migrations tested in staging
  - Environment variables documented
  - Secrets configured in App Platform
  - Health check endpoints verified
  - Rollback procedure documented

- **Deployment Steps**
  1. Create managed databases via DigitalOcean CLI
  2. Configure database connection pools and users
  3. Set up App Platform spec file (do-app.yaml)
  4. Configure environment variables and secrets
  5. Deploy services in order: Database → Backend → Worker → Edge → Frontend
  6. Verify health checks and run smoke tests
  7. Configure custom domain and SSL
  8. Enable monitoring and alerts

- **Post-deployment Validation**
  - All health endpoints return 200 OK
  - Database connections verified
  - Redis connectivity confirmed
  - S3 bucket access validated
  - Media upload and processing pipeline tested
  - Monitoring dashboards populated
  - Alert policies triggering correctly

### Disaster Recovery

- **Backup Strategy**
  - Database: Daily automated + on-demand before deployments
  - Object Storage: Cross-region replication for masters
  - Configuration: Git-versioned infrastructure as code
  - Secrets: Encrypted backup in secure vault

- **Recovery Procedures**
  - Database restoration from snapshot
  - Service redeployment from Git
  - DNS failover to backup region
  - Communication plan for stakeholders
