# Accurate Task List - Media Asset Management Production Deployment

## Current State Assessment (HONEST)
- ✅ Infrastructure scripts created (but NOT executed)
- ✅ Documentation written
- ❌ Backend: 49/63 tests FAILING
- ❌ Routes returning 404 (health, presign, auth)
- ❌ Edge service broken
- ❌ PR#2 blocked by failures
- ❌ NOT deployed to DigitalOcean
- ❌ NOT production ready

## Priority Tasks (Fix First, Deploy Later)

### Task 1: Fix Critical Backend Route Registration Issues
**Goal**: Get backend tests from 49 failures to 0 failures

- [ ] 1.1 Debug why routes in app.ts aren't being registered in index.ts
  - Check if app.ts routes are properly imported
  - Verify Fastify route registration order
  - Fix the disconnect between app.ts and index.ts
  
- [ ] 1.2 Fix /api/health endpoint returning 404
  - Route exists in app.ts but not accessible
  - Ensure health check is registered before other middleware
  
- [ ] 1.3 Fix authentication routes registration
  - /api/auth/register returning 404
  - /api/auth/login returning 404
  - Import and register auth routes properly
  
- [ ] 1.4 Fix presign and asset routes
  - /api/presign returning 404
  - /api/promote returning 404
  - Ensure all routes are registered
  
- [ ] 1.5 Run backend tests and verify 0 failures
  - Must see "63 passed" before proceeding
  - No moving forward until this passes

### Task 2: Fix Edge Service Route Issues
**Goal**: Edge service health check and validation working

- [ ] 2.1 Debug edge service route registration
  - /health endpoint returning 404
  - /validate endpoint issues
  
- [ ] 2.2 Fix HMAC validation logic
  - Ensure signing key is configured
  - Test signature validation
  
- [ ] 2.3 Run edge tests and verify passing
  - All edge integration tests must pass

### Task 3: Fix Database and Redis Connection Issues
**Goal**: Services can connect to databases in test environment

- [ ] 3.1 Fix PostgreSQL connection in tests
  - Use Docker Compose for test database
  - Ensure migrations run properly
  
- [ ] 3.2 Fix Redis connection in tests
  - Configure Redis for test environment
  - Verify queue operations work
  
- [ ] 3.3 Verify all database-dependent tests pass

### Task 4: Update and Merge PR#2
**Goal**: Clean PR with passing CI/CD

- [ ] 4.1 Push all fixes to PR#2 branch
- [ ] 4.2 Ensure GitHub Actions CI passes
- [ ] 4.3 Update PR description with accurate status
- [ ] 4.4 Get PR reviewed and merged

### Task 5: Execute Actual DigitalOcean Deployment
**Goal**: Application running in production (not just scripts)

- [ ] 5.1 Execute infrastructure setup scripts
  - Run VPC creation script
  - Run database provisioning script
  - Verify Wasabi buckets (already exist as mm-*-au)
  
- [ ] 5.2 Deploy application to DigitalOcean App Platform
  - Push Docker images to registry
  - Apply do-app-production.yaml
  - Configure environment variables
  
- [ ] 5.3 Verify production deployment
  - Test all endpoints in production
  - Verify database connections
  - Check monitoring and logs
  
- [ ] 5.4 Update documentation with REAL status
  - Remove false "COMPLETED" claims
  - Document actual deployment state
  - Create honest recap

## Success Criteria
1. Backend: 63/63 tests passing (currently 14/63)
2. Edge: All tests passing
3. PR#2: Merged with clean CI
4. Production: Actually deployed and accessible
5. Documentation: Reflects reality, not wishful thinking

## What NOT to Do
- ❌ Don't claim "COMPLETED" when only scripts exist
- ❌ Don't mark deployment done without actual deployment
- ❌ Don't create recaps claiming 99/100 when tests fail
- ❌ Don't proceed to next task until current one actually works

## Next Immediate Action
Start with Task 1.1 - Debug the route registration issue in backend/src/index.ts vs backend/src/app.ts
