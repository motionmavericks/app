## Current Blockers

1. **CRITICAL**: 49 out of 63 tests are failing
2. **CRITICAL**: Routes returning 404 errors - core functionality broken
3. **BLOCKER**: PR#2 has critical failures that prevent deployment
4. **DEPENDENCY**: Infrastructure scripts created but not executed
5. **STATUS**: Application has NOT been deployed to DigitalOcean

## Next Immediate Actions

1. **PRIORITY 1**: Fix all 49 failing tests before any other work
2. **PRIORITY 2**: Resolve 404 routing errors in backend service
3. **PRIORITY 3**: Only after 100% test pass rate, execute deployment scripts
4. **PRIORITY 4**: Deploy to DigitalOcean and validate functionality
