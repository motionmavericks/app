> Spec: Frontend MAM UI/UX Fixes and Enhancement
> Created: 2025-09-02

## Overview

Enhance the existing frontend to match professional Media Asset Management (MAM) application requirements with comprehensive UI/UX improvements, complete upload/preview workflows, advanced search capabilities, and enterprise-grade user experience. This specification addresses critical gaps in the current implementation to deliver a production-ready creative asset management platform.

## User Stories

### Media Asset Manager
As a creative professional, I want to efficiently upload, organize, preview, and manage video/audio assets with advanced search and metadata capabilities, so that I can streamline my creative workflow and find assets quickly for project delivery.

**Detailed workflow:** Upload assets via drag-and-drop, automatically extract metadata, organize into collections, search by multiple criteria, preview with frame-accurate scrubbing, collaborate through comments and approvals, and export/share assets with controlled access.

### Content Reviewer
As a client or stakeholder, I want to review uploaded content with precise commenting tools and approval workflows, so that I can provide specific feedback on creative assets and track revision history through the review process.

**Detailed workflow:** Access shared assets through secure links, view high-quality previews, add timestamped comments, approve/reject with reasons, track revision history, and receive notifications for project updates.

### System Administrator
As an IT administrator, I want to manage users, monitor system performance, and configure security settings, so that I can ensure secure, efficient operation of the creative asset management platform for the organization.

**Detailed workflow:** Create/manage user accounts and roles, configure storage quotas, monitor upload/processing performance, review access logs, configure security policies, and manage system integrations.
