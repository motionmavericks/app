# Technical Specification

This is the technical specification for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-09-02-frontend-mam-ui-fixes/spec.md

## Technical Requirements

### Upload Interface Enhancement
- **Drag-and-drop zone** with visual feedback using react-dropzone integration
- **Progress tracking** with real-time upload progress bars and cancel functionality  
- **Batch upload queue** with retry logic and error handling for failed uploads
- **File validation** with MIME type checking, size limits, and preview generation
- **Upload resumption** using tus-js-client for large file reliability

### Asset Browser & Grid System
- **Virtual scrolling** implementation using @tanstack/react-virtual for 10,000+ assets
- **Multi-select operations** with keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl+A, Shift+click, Ctrl+click)
- **Responsive grid layout** with CSS Grid and container queries for optimal display
- **Thumbnail lazy loading** with intersection observer and placeholder states
- **Keyboard navigation** with full accessibility compliance (ARIA labels, focus management)

### Media Player Integration  
- **HLS.js integration** with quality selection, adaptive bitrate streaming
- **Custom controls overlay** with frame-accurate scrubbing, playback speed control
- **Fullscreen mode** with proper escape key handling and responsive design
- **Thumbnail previews** on hover with WebVTT subtitle support
- **Playback state management** with resume from last position and watch history

### Search & Filtering System
- **Real-time search** with debounced input and loading indicators
- **Faceted filtering** by file type, date range, tags, collections, status
- **Advanced query builder** with AND/OR logic and saved search presets
- **Search result highlighting** with relevant metadata snippet display
- **Filter persistence** using URL state and localStorage for user preferences

### Metadata Management
- **Dynamic form generation** based on asset type with custom field validation
- **Bulk metadata editing** for selected assets with confirmation dialogs
- **Auto-completion** for tags and categories with smart suggestions
- **Metadata history tracking** with diff view and revert capabilities
- **Custom field types** supporting text, numbers, dates, dropdowns, and file references

### Performance Optimization
- **Code splitting** with dynamic imports for feature-specific bundles
- **Image optimization** with Next.js Image component and WebP/AVIF support
- **API request optimization** with React Query for caching and background updates
- **Bundle analysis** with @next/bundle-analyzer for size monitoring
- **Lazy loading** for off-screen components and heavy UI elements

### UI/UX Design System
- **Design tokens** extending Tailwind config with brand colors and spacing
- **Component library** using Radix UI primitives with consistent theming
- **Dark/light theme** with system preference detection and toggle persistence  
- **Responsive breakpoints** optimized for desktop, tablet, and mobile workflows
- **Loading states** with skeleton screens and progressive enhancement
- **Error boundaries** with user-friendly error messages and recovery actions

### State Management
- **React Query** for server state management with optimistic updates
- **Zustand** for client-side state (UI preferences, selections, filters)
- **URL state synchronization** for bookmarkable searches and deep linking
- **Local storage persistence** for user preferences and draft data
- **Optimistic updates** with rollback on API failures

### Integration Architecture
- **API client abstraction** with consistent error handling and retry logic
- **WebSocket connections** for real-time processing status updates
- **Event-driven updates** using custom hooks for cross-component communication
- **Authentication integration** with JWT token management and refresh
- **Error monitoring** with Sentry integration for production debugging
