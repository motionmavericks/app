# Cleanup and Improvement Plan

## Phase 1: Immediate Cleanup Actions

### 1. Remove Large Binary Files
**Files to Remove:**
- `awscliv2.zip` (62MB) - AWS CLI installer
- `bin/yq` (9.6MB) - Binary executable

**Actions:**
- Remove files from git repository using `git rm --cached`
- Update .gitignore to prevent re-committing
- Document proper installation methods in README/docs

### 2. Update .gitignore
**Add Patterns:**
- `awscliv2.zip`
- `bin/yq`
- `aws/dist/`
- Binary file patterns (*.exe, *.dll, *.so, *.dylib)

### 3. Address Documentation Issues
**Files to Update:**
- `edge/Caddyfile` - Remove or complete TODO comment
- `edge/README.md` - Update documentation to reflect current implementation

## Phase 2: Security Improvements

### 1. Add Security Scanning to CI
**Actions:**
- Add npm audit check to CI pipeline
- Implement dependency scanning for security vulnerabilities
- Add secrets scanning to prevent committing sensitive information

### 2. Review Environment Variables
**Actions:**
- Ensure all sensitive variables are properly managed
- Document environment variable requirements clearly
- Implement validation for required environment variables

## Phase 3: Documentation Enhancements

### 1. Complete Edge Service Documentation
**Actions:**
- Update edge/README.md with complete implementation details
- Document HMAC signature validation process
- Add examples of valid requests

### 2. Enhance Deployment Documentation
**Actions:**
- Update deployment guides with current processes
- Document DO App Platform deployment steps
- Add troubleshooting guides for common deployment issues

## Phase 4: Code Quality Improvements

### 1. Add Comprehensive Test Suites
**Actions:**
- Implement unit tests for all services
- Add integration tests for critical paths
- Implement code coverage requirements (target: 80%+)

### 2. Implement Code Quality Checks
**Actions:**
- Add linting and formatting checks to CI pipeline
- Implement TypeScript type checking in all services
- Add automated code quality gates

## Phase 5: Deployment Optimization

### 1. Optimize Docker Images
**Actions:**
- Use multi-stage builds to reduce image sizes
- Implement proper health checks
- Use distroless or alpine base images where possible

### 2. Add Monitoring and Alerting
**Actions:**
- Implement application logging
- Add monitoring dashboards
- Set up alerting for critical issues

## Implementation Timeline

### Week 1: Immediate Cleanup
- Remove large binary files
- Update .gitignore
- Address documentation issues

### Week 2: Security and Documentation
- Implement security scanning
- Complete documentation updates
- Review environment variable management

### Week 3: Code Quality
- Add test suites
- Implement code quality checks
- Set up code coverage requirements

### Week 4: Deployment Optimization
- Optimize Docker images
- Implement monitoring and alerting
- Finalize deployment documentation

## Success Metrics

1. **Repository Size Reduction**: Reduce repository size by removing large binaries
2. **Security Compliance**: Zero critical security vulnerabilities in dependencies
3. **Code Coverage**: Achieve 80%+ code coverage across all services
4. **Deployment Reliability**: 99% successful deployment rate
5. **Documentation Completeness**: 100% of services have comprehensive documentation

## Rollback Plan

If any changes cause issues:
1. Revert to previous commit using git revert
2. Restore removed files if necessary
3. Document lessons learned
4. Implement fixes in a new branch

## Approval

This plan should be reviewed and approved by the team before implementation begins.
