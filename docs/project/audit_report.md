# Codebase Audit Report

## Executive Summary

The repository is a well-structured monorepo for a media processing application with four main services:
- Frontend (Next.js)
- Backend (Fastify API)
- Worker (Preview generation)
- Edge (HLS delivery proxy)

The CI/CD workflows have been recently refactored and improved. However, there are several areas that need attention for better maintainability, security, and deployment readiness.

## Repository Structure Analysis

### Strengths
1. Well-organized monorepo structure with clear service separation
2. Comprehensive documentation in the docs/ directory
3. Recent improvements to CI/CD workflows with path-based filtering
4. Good use of TypeScript across all services
5. Proper environment variable management with .env.example files

### Issues Identified

#### 1. Large Binary Files in Repository
- **awscliv2.zip** (62MB): AWS CLI installer that shouldn't be version controlled
- **bin/yq** (9.6MB): Binary executable that should be installed via package manager
- **aws/dist/** directory: Contains compiled binaries that shouldn't be committed

#### 2. Git Ignore Issues
- Missing patterns for large binaries and temporary files
- Some files that should be ignored are not properly ignored

#### 3. Documentation Gaps
- TODO comment in `edge/Caddyfile` about HMAC validation
- Incomplete documentation in `edge/README.md`

#### 4. Security Considerations
- Large binary files in repository increase attack surface
- Potential for committing sensitive information in binary files

#### 5. Deployment Readiness
- Repository contains unnecessary large files that slow down cloning
- Some deployment scripts reference binaries that should be installed at runtime

## Detailed Service Analysis

### Frontend (Next.js)
- Well-structured with modern dependencies
- Using TailwindCSS v4
- Proper environment variable setup with NEXT_PUBLIC_* prefixes

### Backend (Fastify)
- REST API with proper validation using Zod
- Good separation of concerns
- Uses PostgreSQL and Redis appropriately

### Worker (Preview Generation)
- Focused service for media processing
- Uses Redis streams for job queuing
- GPU acceleration support

### Edge Service
- Fastify-based proxy for HLS delivery
- HMAC signature validation implemented in code
- Caddyfile has TODO for HMAC validation (redundant with application-level validation)

## CI/CD Analysis

### Strengths
- Recent refactor with path-based filtering for efficient builds
- Proper concurrency controls in deployment workflows
- Tag-based deployment with sha-* tags
- Secrets preservation via live spec approach

### Areas for Improvement
- Documentation of deployment process could be enhanced
- Some workflow files have hardcoded values that could be parameterized

## Recommendations

### 1. Immediate Cleanup Actions
- Remove large binary files from repository
- Update .gitignore to prevent future binary commits
- Address TODO comments in documentation

### 2. Security Improvements
- Implement security scanning in CI pipeline
- Add dependency audit checks
- Review environment variable usage for sensitive data

### 3. Documentation Enhancements
- Complete edge service documentation
- Update deployment guides
- Add troubleshooting guides for common issues

### 4. Deployment Optimization
- Optimize Docker images for smaller footprints
- Implement proper health checks
- Add monitoring and alerting setup guides

### 5. Code Quality Improvements
- Add comprehensive test suites
- Implement code coverage requirements
- Add linting and formatting checks to CI

## Priority Action Items

### High Priority (Immediate)
1. Remove awscliv2.zip and bin/yq from repository
2. Update .gitignore to prevent binary file commits
3. Address TODO comments in edge service

### Medium Priority (Short-term)
1. Add security scanning to CI pipeline
2. Implement comprehensive test suites
3. Enhance deployment documentation

### Low Priority (Long-term)
1. Optimize Docker images
2. Add monitoring and alerting
3. Implement advanced CI/CD features

## Conclusion

The codebase is in good shape overall with recent improvements to the CI/CD workflows. The main issues are related to large binary files in the repository and some documentation gaps. Addressing these issues will improve the repository's maintainability, security, and deployment readiness.
