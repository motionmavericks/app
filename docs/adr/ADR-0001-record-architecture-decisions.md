# ADR-0001: Record Architecture Decisions

Context
- We need a durable way to capture significant decisions and their rationale.

Decision
- Use Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) in `docs/adr/` with sequential IDs.

Consequences
- Decisions are reviewable and traceable; updates add new ADRs, not edits.

Status
- Accepted â€” 2025-08-31.
