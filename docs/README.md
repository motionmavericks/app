# Docs Home

Welcome to the production system documentation. This space tracks our end‑to‑end plan, decisions, and runbooks as we build a Frame.io‑style platform with immutable masters in Wasabi and ephemeral previews.

- Start with System Overview and Architecture.
- Use the sidebar to navigate by topic (ingest, storage, previews, deploy, ops).
- Propose changes via PRs. Record big choices in ADRs.

Conventions
- Style: concise, imperative, production‑oriented.
- Dates: ISO `YYYY‑MM‑DD`.
- Paths/commands: monospace.
- Status labels: Draft, In Review, Approved.

Links
- System overview: `../.agent-os/product/mission.md`
- ADRs: `adr/`
- MCP Tools: `ai/mcp-tools-development-guide.md` and `ai/mcp-configuration-guide.md`
