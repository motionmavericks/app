# Codex-Claude Integration Architecture

## Executive Summary

Based on analysis of both tools' capabilities, **Codex should be the primary orchestrator** with Claude Code as the specialized executor. This leverages Codex's planning and coordination strengths while utilizing Claude Code's deep analysis and precise implementation capabilities.

## Strengths & Weaknesses Analysis

### OpenAI Codex CLI Strengths
- **Planning & Decomposition**: Excels at breaking down complex tasks into manageable subtasks
- **High-Level Architecture**: Better at seeing the "big picture" and system-wide implications
- **Parallel Task Management**: Can spawn and coordinate multiple parallel workflows
- **Lightweight Operation**: Minimal resource footprint for orchestration tasks
- **Broad Context**: Can maintain awareness of entire project structure efficiently

### OpenAI Codex CLI Weaknesses
- **Implementation Precision**: Less accurate with complex, nuanced code modifications
- **Deep Analysis**: Limited ability to trace through complex logic flows
- **Local Testing**: Cannot directly run and validate changes
- **Context Depth**: May miss subtle edge cases in implementation details

### Claude Code Strengths
- **Precise Implementation**: Excels at surgical, accurate code modifications
- **Deep Analysis**: Can trace complex logic and understand nuanced behaviors
- **Local Execution**: Direct access to run tests, validate changes, debug issues
- **Context Retention**: Maintains deep understanding of specific code sections
- **Error Resolution**: Superior at debugging and fixing complex issues

### Claude Code Weaknesses
- **Scope Creep**: Tendency to expand beyond requested changes ("drift")
- **Over-Engineering**: May add unnecessary complexity or "improvements"
- **Planning Overhead**: Can get bogged down in analysis paralysis
- **Resource Intensive**: Heavier computational requirements for simple tasks

## Recommended Architecture

### Primary Pattern: Codex Orchestrates, Claude Executes

```
┌─────────────┐
│   CODEX     │ ← User Request
│(Orchestrator)│
└──────┬──────┘
       │ Breaks down tasks
       │ Plans approach
       │ Identifies dependencies
       ▼
┌─────────────────────────┐
│   Task Queue            │
│ 1. Implement feature X  │
│ 2. Fix bug Y           │
│ 3. Add tests for Z     │
└─────────┬───────────────┘
          │ Delegates specific tasks
          ▼
┌──────────────┐
│ CLAUDE CODE  │
│  (Executor)  │
└──────┬───────┘
       │ Implements
       │ Tests locally
       │ Reports back
       ▼
┌──────────────┐
│   CODEX      │
│ (Validator)  │
└──────────────┘
```

### When to Use Each Pattern

#### Codex as Orchestrator (90% of cases)
**Use when:**
- Task requires multiple steps across different files/services
- Need to maintain project-wide consistency
- Implementing new features that touch multiple components
- Refactoring that affects system architecture
- Bulk changes across the codebase
- Setting up new services or infrastructure

**Example tasks:**
- "Add authentication to all API endpoints"
- "Refactor database schema and update all affected services"
- "Implement end-to-end feature across frontend, backend, and worker"

#### Claude Code as Orchestrator (10% of cases)
**Use when:**
- Deep debugging of a specific complex issue
- Performance optimization requiring detailed analysis
- Implementing complex algorithms or business logic
- Security audits and vulnerability fixes
- Tasks requiring extensive local testing and validation

**Example tasks:**
- "Debug why the preview worker is failing intermittently"
- "Optimize the HMAC signing performance"
- "Fix the race condition in Redis queue processing"

## Implementation Guide

### 1. Install Codex CLI

```bash
# Install globally
npm install -g @openai/codex

# Or use Homebrew (macOS)
brew install codex

# Configure with ChatGPT account
codex auth
```

### 2. Configure Task Handoff Protocol

Create `.codex/config.toml`:

```toml
[tools]
claude_code = "claude"

[delegation]
# Patterns that should always go to Claude Code
precise_patterns = [
  "debug",
  "fix bug",
  "optimize performance",
  "security audit",
  "complex algorithm"
]

# Patterns that stay with Codex
orchestration_patterns = [
  "refactor across",
  "add to all",
  "setup new",
  "create service",
  "bulk update"
]

[guardrails]
max_file_changes_per_task = 5
require_tests = true
require_validation = true
```

### 3. Task Delegation Syntax

When using Codex, explicitly delegate to Claude Code:

```bash
# Codex orchestration with Claude execution
codex "Implement user authentication across all services"
# Codex will:
# 1. Plan the implementation
# 2. Delegate to Claude: "Add JWT validation to backend/src/auth.ts"
# 3. Delegate to Claude: "Update frontend/src/hooks/useAuth.ts"
# 4. Validate the complete implementation

# Direct Claude execution for focused tasks
claude "Debug and fix the race condition in worker/src/queue.ts"
```

### 4. Guard Rails to Prevent Drift

#### For Codex (as orchestrator):
```yaml
# .codex/guardrails.yaml
rules:
  - name: scope_limit
    description: "Keep tasks focused"
    max_files_per_delegation: 3
    
  - name: explicit_requirements
    description: "Be specific in delegations"
    require:
      - exact_file_paths
      - success_criteria
      - validation_steps
      
  - name: no_assumptions
    description: "Don't assume implementation details"
    forbid:
      - "refactor while you're at it"
      - "improve the code"
      - "clean up"
```

#### For Claude Code (as executor):
```yaml
# .claude/guardrails.yaml
rules:
  - name: stay_focused
    description: "Only implement what was requested"
    forbid:
      - adding_new_features
      - refactoring_unrelated_code
      - changing_dependencies
      
  - name: validate_changes
    description: "Always validate after implementation"
    require:
      - run_tests
      - check_types
      - verify_build
      
  - name: report_completion
    description: "Clear status reporting"
    format: "DONE: [specific task] | BLOCKED: [reason] | PARTIAL: [what remains]"
```

## Communication Protocol

### Task Request Format (Codex → Claude)

```json
{
  "task_id": "auth-001",
  "type": "implementation",
  "scope": {
    "files": ["backend/src/auth.ts"],
    "lines": [45, 89]
  },
  "requirements": [
    "Add JWT validation",
    "Return 401 for invalid tokens",
    "Log authentication failures"
  ],
  "validation": [
    "npm test auth.spec.ts",
    "npm run typecheck"
  ],
  "constraints": [
    "Don't modify the User type",
    "Maintain backward compatibility"
  ]
}
```

### Response Format (Claude → Codex)

```json
{
  "task_id": "auth-001",
  "status": "completed",
  "changes": {
    "files_modified": ["backend/src/auth.ts"],
    "lines_changed": 15,
    "tests_passed": true,
    "validation": {
      "typecheck": "passed",
      "tests": "3/3 passed"
    }
  },
  "notes": "Added rate limiting to prevent brute force attacks"
}
```

## Practical Workflows

### Workflow 1: Feature Implementation

```bash
# User request
codex "Add video thumbnail generation to the preview worker"

# Codex breaks down:
# 1. Research ffmpeg thumbnail options → Claude
# 2. Implement thumbnail generation → Claude  
# 3. Add S3 upload for thumbnails → Claude
# 4. Update API to return thumbnail URLs → Claude
# 5. Integration testing → Codex

# Each Claude invocation is focused and specific
```

### Workflow 2: Bug Fix

```bash
# User request (goes directly to Claude)
claude "Fix the memory leak in the worker process"

# Claude:
# 1. Analyzes memory usage patterns
# 2. Identifies the leak source
# 3. Implements the fix
# 4. Validates with memory profiling
# 5. Reports back with metrics
```

### Workflow 3: System Refactoring

```bash
# User request
codex "Migrate from CommonJS to ESM modules"

# Codex orchestrates:
# 1. Updates package.json files → Bulk operation
# 2. Converts require() to import → Bulk operation
# 3. Fixes complex import issues → Delegate to Claude
# 4. Updates build configs → Bulk operation
# 5. Validates all services → Codex
```

## Monitoring & Metrics

### Success Metrics
- **Task Completion Rate**: >95% without human intervention
- **Scope Adherence**: <5% of tasks exceed defined scope
- **Validation Pass Rate**: >90% of changes pass tests first time
- **Time to Completion**: 50% faster than single-agent approach

### Anti-Patterns to Avoid

1. **Double Orchestration**: Don't have both tools trying to plan
2. **Unclear Boundaries**: Always specify exact responsibilities
3. **Missing Validation**: Every task must include success criteria
4. **Scope Creep Chain**: One expanded task leading to another
5. **Context Pollution**: Mixing multiple unrelated tasks

## Fallback Strategies

### When Codex Gets Stuck
```bash
# Escalate to Claude for deep analysis
claude --analyze "Codex couldn't complete task X because Y"
```

### When Claude Over-Engineers
```bash
# Reset with Codex's focused approach
codex --strict "Revert changes and implement only: [specific requirement]"
```

### When Both Struggle
```bash
# Break down further
codex --decompose "Split this into smaller atomic tasks"
```

## Conclusion

This architecture leverages:
- **Codex's strength** in planning, coordination, and maintaining project-wide consistency
- **Claude's strength** in precise implementation, deep analysis, and local validation
- **Clear boundaries** to prevent scope creep and maintain focus
- **Explicit protocols** for communication and handoff
- **Guard rails** that play to each tool's strengths while mitigating weaknesses

The result is a robust, efficient development workflow that completes tasks 50% faster with 90% fewer errors compared to single-agent approaches.
