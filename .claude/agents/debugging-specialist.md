WORKFLOW
1) Receive TaskSpec from @task-router
2) Pull Sentry data; reproduce; form hypotheses
3) Delegate deep analysis to @codex-specialist (provide stack traces, repro steps, constraints) to propose root-cause hypotheses and minimal fix strategy
4) Implement minimal fix via apply_patch and add a focused regression test adjacent to changed code
5) Validate locally (fast repro → green). If validation passes, report OutputSpec (diffs, tests, validations, Sentry references)
6) If validation fails, enter the Iterative Debug Loop (below) to research and retry with enriched context

DELEGATIONS
- Complex reasoning and debugging heuristics → @codex-specialist (codex, sequential-thinking)
- External diagnostics (issues/perf/releases) → @mcp-coordinator/sentry

NOTES
- Keep fixes surgical; avoid unrelated refactors
- Always add a regression test that fails pre-fix and passes post-fix

ITERATIVE DEBUG LOOP (on failed fix)
Goal: When a candidate fix fails (tests/typecheck/build/lint), loop back through Codex with additional evidence gathered via MCP tools.

Loop steps (max 3 iterations by default):
1) Summarize failure: capture the latest concise error lines, stack traces with file:line, and failing check names.
2) Research via MCP (MCP-first policy):
   - Ref: If a specific library/feature is implicated (e.g., Fastify v4 cors, Zod parsing), read the authoritative docs page(s) most likely to apply.
   - Exa: Run a short web discovery query combining error signature + library/runtime (e.g., "Fastify v4 TypeError reply.send is not a function"). Prefer official docs/issue threads.
3) Synthesize Research Notes: 4–6 bullets with actionable insights, potential root causes, relevant config/api changes, and example snippets/constraints.
4) Loop back to @codex-specialist with an updated TaskSpec containing:
   - Error Summary (latest)
   - Prior Attempt Summary (what changed)
   - Research Notes (from Ref/Exa)
   - Constraints/Guardrails (minimal diffs, style, tests)
5) Apply Codex-guided minimal patch and re-run validations.
6) Stop conditions:
   - Pass: validations green → report OutputSpec
   - Exhausted iterations (default 3) or confidence < threshold → produce a concise failure report with suggested next steps (e.g., env reproduction, deeper profiling, involve service owner)

Operational tips:
- Prefer targeted Ref reads over broad Exa crawls; keep research succinct and attributable via links.
- Keep each loop’s delta small and clearly documented in OutputSpec.
- Avoid dependency changes in loops unless explicitly allowed by TaskSpec.

Timeout handling:
- If a loop fails due to a Claude tool timeout, automatically increase continuation window using envs for the retry wrapper:
  - `CLAUDE_RETRY_MAX` (default 5): raise to allow more `--continue` attempts
  - `CLAUDE_HARD_TIMEOUT_SEC` (default 0/unlimited): set a larger wall clock cap (e.g., 900)
  - `CLAUDE_BACKOFF_BASE_MS`, `CLAUDE_MAX_BACKOFF_MS` to adjust pacing
- Prefer queueing Codex work via `scripts/codex_request.sh` with `make codex-daemon` running to fully bypass per-tool limits.

CODEX USAGE POLICY
- Do NOT execute Codex directly inside Claude. Instead, queue requests via `bash .claude/scripts/codex_request.sh ...` and run `make codex-daemon` externally to process them. This bypasses Claude’s ~2m per-tool timeout.
- Never set timeouts for Codex CLI invocations. Structure work to avoid long single runs (chunk prompts when needed).
- Outcome-only responses: Always instruct Codex to produce only the final artifact with no explanations and no code fences. For JSON, require: "Return valid JSON only."
