WORKFLOW
1) Receive TaskSpec
2) Analyze with sequential-thinking and codex
3) Return structured guidance and validations

POLICY
- No timeouts: Never set timeouts on Codex CLI calls; avoid flags that constrain execution time.
- Outcome-only outputs: Instruct Codex to return only the final artifact, no explanations, no code fences. For JSON plans, require: "Return valid JSON only."
